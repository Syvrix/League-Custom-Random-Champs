TODO
Lists should be in Json format.
- List of all champions in game
- List of all roles(top, jungle, mid, adc, supp) with champions assigned to them.
- Champion pool size (amount of champions that should be randomly generated for each team)
- role dependent (Where atleast 1 of each role should exist in the pool.) 


Modifiers accepted are
 x, role_dependent, role_amount

 x =                = The pool size that should be generated for each team
 role_dependent     = is a 'yes' or 'no' modifier so there is atleast 1 champion of atleast 1 of the roles.
 role_amount        = How many champions that should be generated of the existing roles, if 2 is input, there will be atleast 2 champions with the role ADC, or support...
